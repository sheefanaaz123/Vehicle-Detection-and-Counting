# Vehicle-Detection-and-Counting

In this project, we can detect and count vehicles using OpenCV (a computer vision library) in Python.

This Vehicle Detection and Counting project using OpenCV can be used in a variety of industries to improve efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and enhance safety and security.
 
 This Vehicle Detection and Counting project using OpenCV can have several practical uses, including:
 
 Traffic monitoring: The system can be used to monitor traffic in real-time and provide accurate data on the number of vehicles passing through a particular area.
 
 Environmental Monitoring: Vehicle detection and counting can be used to monitor and reduce air pollution by tracking the number of vehicles on the road and the emissions they produce.
 
 We will use the Python programming language to work with images and for image analysis, and the OpenCV computer vision library to perform the image processing tasks. There are a few libraries that can be used for detecting vehicles in images, but the one we will use is OpenCV. OpenCV can be downloaded from https://www.opencv.org/. OpenCV is a cross-platform library containing code for image processing, computer vision and machine learning. It has gained a lot of popularity due to its low memory requirements and easy integration into other programming languages.
