# Vehicle-Detection-and-Counting
There are many devices in our lives that we rely on to do their specific job. A car, a phone, an oven - they all have one common task: detecting and counting things. In this article, we will learn how we can detect and count vehicles using OpenCV (a computer vision library) in Python. We will use the Python programming language to work with images and for image analysis, and the OpenCV computer vision library to perform the image processing tasks. There are a few libraries that can be used for detecting vehicles in images, but the one we will use is OpenCV. OpenCV can be downloaded from https://www.opencv.org/. OpenCV is a cross-platform library containing code for image processing, computer vision and machine learning. It has gained a lot of popularity due to its low memory requirements and easy integration into other programming languages. For this project, we will be using OpenCV to detect the vehicle and count the number of vehicles in the video .
